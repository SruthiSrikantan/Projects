# Biostatistics Project
In this biostatistics project I assess the link between jaundice and UTI in neonatal infants. I utilized data from a research paper and used a Chi squared test and Fisher's exact test to see if I could obtain similar findings to the original researchers in R. Additionally, I created a report detailing statistical findings which can be accessed above.
